# Triangulation
Basic triangulation using otectomy algorithm (ear clipping) for comp. geometry lectures

For execution call from command line:
```
python main.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -t <index|value>
```
- Input file contains vertices of polygon
- Output file contains diagonals build by algorithm for triangulation of polygon
- Last argument defines edge type: two points by indecies in array from output file or by values
